# words2numbers

This script translates character strings into integer vectors representing their numeric expression in the Spanish language.

Sometimes is needed to parse financial documents containing text refering money (or any numerical amount) expressed not in numbers but in words.

This is my first attempt (quick & dirty of course).

Feel free to contact me for making any suggestion
